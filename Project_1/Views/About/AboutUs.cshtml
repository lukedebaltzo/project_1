        This site was established by 4 returned missionaries. The purpose of this site is to help recently-called missionaries to connect with returned missionaries. We hope that you will use this resource to prepare you for your mission by asking questions to the missionaries who have served in your areas before you. If you feel so inclined to, you are invited to return after your missions and help other missionaries prepare!

    "Dear Future Missionary" is a variation of the "Dear Elder" company that advocates for more meaningful communication between missionaries and their friends and family. With the recent change to allow missionaries to call, skype, and text their families weekly, we can tell how important communication is for missionaries. Practice spreading messages now by sharing this site with your friends who will serve or have served. Thanks!
